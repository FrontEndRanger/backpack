#Backpack - CSS Framework
Backpack is a set of CSS modules that help to speed up the front-end development of any app or website.

It tries to be as lightweight as possible. No styling is use in the core files, so you don't have many css overrides, instead you have to theme your project. You can also define your own class names.
